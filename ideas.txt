Landing page pitch:
	Drop dead simple. 
	DOUGHNUT is designed from the ground-up to do one thing and do it well((link to Wikipedia article on Unix philosophy)): keep track of your day-to-day expenses. Forget about endless by using hotkeys and a clean, lean user interface.
	
	Up and running in under a minute.
	By using OpenAuth, you can sign in by using your existing Google, Facebook or Twitter account. If that's not your fancy, you can create a traditional user account by providing nothing more than a valid email and a password. It's fast, and it's ???
	
	!!! 
	Free forever, open-source. ((banner!))
