DOUGHNUT
	- convention, then configuration

	- openauth, or simple sign up with just email and password; no need to wait for confirmation
	- free forever
	- no advertising
	- KEYBINDINGS and huge UX emphasis on rapid data entry; get on, add your shit, get off and go do something else, very few menus and configuration
